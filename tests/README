This is the directory with all test routines in SWEET.

All tests are prefixed with a number which determines a certain order in which tests should be executed first.


	05: The functionality of detecting failure of tests (failure of test) is tested first

	10: Compilation of programs is tested next.

	20: Some tests for properly working scripts to create jobs

	50: Basic functionality of SWEET routines

	70: Tests for particular programs realized in SWEET



All test directories should be named with an insightful name

The testing routines search for the file
	./test.sh
or
	./test.py
in each test directory.
This file might be executed not from within the test directory.

Therefore, the first command executed in each of these scripts
should be to change the directory to its directory.
