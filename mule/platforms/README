Special configuration has to be setup for each cluster.
This is required due to the different configurations on each cluster.

Each platform requries a directory to be created in the ./platform directory:

./mule/platform/[uniqueIdentiier]/[config files]

The placeholder [uniqueIdentifier] should be related to the platform.

All files in [config files] should include a test for each specific platform.
Only if the correct platform is detected, the platform-specific parts should
be executed.

Possible config files:

	./env_vars.sh:
		Included by ./local_software/env_vars.sh
		Setup additional environment variables, e.g.
		MULE_CC,
		MULE_CXX,
		MULE_F90,
		MULE_MPICC,
		MULE_MPICXX,
		MULE_MPIF90
		to override compiler environment variables

	./JobPlatformAutodetect.py
		Script which includes autodetect() function to
		automatically determine the right environment

	./JobPlatform.py
		Included by files ./python_mods/MULE*.py
		

	./local_software_default.sh
		Information on software packages in
			[sweet root]/local_sofware/
		to install on this platform, see
			[sweet root]/local_sofware/setup_local_software.sh
