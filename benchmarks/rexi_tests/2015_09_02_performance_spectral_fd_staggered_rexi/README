comparison of accuracy between spectral methods, finite difference methods, and FD on staggered grid methods


finite differences (C-grid):
	A resolution of 256x256 is required to reduce the RMS error to the order of 10^-5

spectral methods:
	Always accurate

finite differences (A-grid):
	The error with a resolution of 256^2 is still on the order of 10^-4
