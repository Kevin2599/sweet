Shallow Water Equation Environment for Tests, Awesome!

This library supports various kinds of simulations (not only Shallow Water)
on 2D surfaces. The currently supported surfaces are
  * the 2D torus (bi-periodic plane) and
  * the sphere

For discretization, we use the double FFT for the plane and Spherical Harmonics
on the sphere.

Coding:
**************************

	Please read the coding conventions in doc/coding_conventions
	These conventions are suggestions.



**************************
Compilation:
**************************

	First of all, setup the environment variables correctly
	(see also INSTALL file):

	$ source ./local_software/env_vars.sh

	The compilation is then done by calling 'scons' which is a
	makefile alternative and offers the flexibility of Python.

	$ scons --program=swe_staggered_vector_invariant


	The possible compilation options are visible via

	$ scons --help

	The program to be compiled can be specified via -program=...
	with the list of programs given in src/examples
