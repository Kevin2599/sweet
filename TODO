* different domain lengths and resolutions

* check coriolis f term (no dimensionalization should be required)
  (partly done, f term has to be scaled with the domain length in each direction)
  DONE

* Stabilize rotated f-plane (gets instabilities)
  Cannot work due to missing symmetries
  DONE

* Check scaling of f
  DONE, works

* Implement RKn
  DONE
  
* FFT: Get running for resx != resy

* Implement spectral derivative

* Maybe implement Adams-Bashforth

* Implement NEMO-like model

* Add Williamson test benches:
1) Advection
2) Balances
5) Mountain
6) Rot. shallow water

* Add test bench for Galewski unstable jet
