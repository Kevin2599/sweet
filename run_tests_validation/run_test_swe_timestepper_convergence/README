These scripts help to test the convergence of the different SWE TS methods

These are the same scripts as they are used to generate jobscripts to submit
at compute clusters.

Steps:
	1) Cleanup directory:
	   ./cleanup.sh

	2) Generate benchmarks:
	   ./jobs_create.py [group=l1/l2/ln1/ln2] [tsmethod] [order1] [order2]")

	   where

	   [group] is one of the benchmarking groups
	           which also chooses the reference solution
	           l1: Linear 1st order
	           l2: Linear 2nd order
	           nl1: Nonlinear 1st order
	           nl2: Nonlinear 2nd order

	   [tsmethod] name of time stepping method

	   [order1] order of time stepping method 1 (if applicable)

	   [order2] order of time stepping method 2 (if applicable)

	   This generates multiple job scripts, each one over 
	   a certain time integration range, and using a standard benchmark
	   scenario.

	   This also generates a reference solution which is computed with
	         ln_erk and 4-th order.
	   This reference solution is used in the postprocessing to
	   test for the correct convergence.

	3) Execute benchmarks:
	   ./run_jobs.sh

	   The execution of this script runs all previously created benchmarks.

	4) Run postprocessing (and validation tests):
	   ./postprocessing.py

	   This python script iterates over all possibly executed validation
	   benchmarks.
	   It automatically detects sets of jobscripts which were executed with
	   the same time stepping methods, but with different time step sizes.
	   It then compares the convergence to the reference solution and that
	   convergence is given for the first time step increases.
