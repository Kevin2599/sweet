These scripts help to test the convergence of the different SWE TS methods

Steps:
	1) Cleanup directory:
	   ./cleanup.sh

	2) Generate benchmarks:

	   ./jobs_create.py [group=l1/l2/ln1/ln2] [tsmethod] [order1] [order2]")

	   where

	   [group] is one of the benchmarking groups
	           which also chooses the reference solution
	           l1: Linear 1st order
	           l2: Linear 2nd order
	           nl1: Nonlinear 1st order
	           nl2: Nonlinear 2nd order

	   [tsmethod] name of time stepping method

	   [order1] order of time stepping method 1 (if applicable)

	   [order2] order of time stepping method 2 (if applicable)

	3) Execute benchmarks:
	   ./run_jobs.sh

	4) Run postprocessing (and validation tests):
	   ./postprocessing.py
