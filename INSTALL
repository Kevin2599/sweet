There are scripts in the directory 'local_software' to make handling
external software requirements easier. Not all software packages are
required on all platforms. E.g. installing `autoconf` is only required
if the version on the platform is too old.

The scripts are named as follows:

 * ./install_*.sh
   Build and install the 3rd party software automatically
   Please note that this does not generate highly optimized 3rd party
   software, but focusses on getting SWEET running.

 * ./env_vars.sh (See below for more information on how to use this script!)
   This script sets up all the environment variables to compile and run SWEET

After installing the software, you can use

	source ./local_software/env_vars.sh

from the SWEET source code directory to setup your
environment variables correctly.



================
Autoconf:
================
	Only install autoconf from the ./local_software directory
	if your currently installed version is too old (e.g. on some
	compute cluster)


================
SCons:
================
	SCons is required for building SWEET
	http://www.scons.org/

	OR
	apt-get install scons
	

================
FFTW (optional): mandatory if Fourier space is required
================
	http://www.fftw.org/download.html
	fftw-3.3.4.tar.gz

	tar xzf fftw-3.3.4.tar.gz
	Without MPI:
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/sweet_support --with-our-malloc16 --enable-openmp --enable-avx --enable-shared
	With MPI:
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/sweet_support --with-our-malloc16 --enable-openmp --enable-avx --enable-mpi --enable-shared
	make -j 4 install

	For intel compiler, use e.g.:
	./configure CC=icc CFLAGS="-gcc -xHost" --with-our-malloc16 --enable-openmp --enable-avx --prefix=$HOME/local/fftw-3.3.4
	make install

	OR
	apt-get install libfftw3-dev


================
SHTNS (optional): Required for Spherical Harmonics
================

	If you like to run simulations with spherical harmonics, you
	need to install the SHTNS library:
	
	$ ./install_shtns.sh


================
LAPACK (optional): Required for REXI on the sphere for spectral space solver
================

	Lapack is required to solve the diagonal-blocked partitions of the spectral
	matrix. Instsall with

	$ ./install_lapack.sh


================
SDL (optional): Graphical user interface to simulations
================
	The GUI depends on libSDL2
	https://www.libsdl.org/

	apt-get install libsdl2-dev

	OR
	
	Download  http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.X.X.tar.gz
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/SDL2-2.0.3
	make -j 4
	make install
	Add the SDL2-2.0.3 to manually installed libraries 
	 enviromental variables to import them.
	 (Such as in $HOME/bin/local_vars.sh).


================
NUMA (optional): Optimized memory allocation
================
	Get libnuma from
	ftp://oss.sgi.com/www/projects/libnuma/download/numactl-2.0.10.tar.gz


================
MPI - (Optional)
================
	Get OpenMPI or other MPI parallelization library
	http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.8/
	openmpi-1.8.6.tar.bz2

	tar xzf openmpi-1.8.6.tar.bz2
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/sweet_support
	make -j 4 install


================
PFFT
================
	NOT YET REQUIRED (future work):
	Get PFFT from the following website:
	https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~mpip/software.php#pfft
	pfft-1.0.8-alpha.tar.gz

	tar xzf pfft-1.0.8-alpha.tar.gz
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/sweet_support
